This project was to test build a google hompeage replica with the use of
google dev tools, html, css, and git.  I learned a lot more about the
dev tools and how they can easily help you learn new tricks for your own pages
i managed to set up most html by myself with a few div's being copied.
the css was a mixture of my own work and another page that i had refrence to.
Being busy with life i had to work on this project at mutilpe different times.
Doing this i really learned a lot more about how git works by having to access
the files and push them so many different times.
